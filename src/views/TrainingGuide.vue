          <h2>How to Use This Guide</h2>
          <p>
            This training guide is designed to help basketball players of all levels improve their vertical jump
            and develop the skills necessary for dunking. Whether you're just starting your dunking journey or
            looking to add more impressive dunks to your repertoire, you'll find valuable information and
            structured training programs here.
          </p>
          <p>
            The programs are organized by skill level and specific goals. Follow the recommended schedule
            and progression guidelines for the best results. Remember that consistency is key - improvements
            in vertical jump require dedicated training over time.

          question: 'How long will it take to see results?',
          answer: 'Most athletes see noticeable improvements in their vertical jump within 4-6 weeks of consistent training. However, the time frame varies based on your starting point, genetics, and how consistently you follow the program. For significant improvements (6+ inches), expect to train consistently for 3-6 months.'
        },
        {
          question: 'How often should I train my vertical jump?',
          answer: 'For optimal results, dedicate 3-4 days per week to vertical jump training. This includes a mix of strength training, plyometrics, and technique work. Always allow at least 48 hours of recovery between intense plyometric or lower body strength sessions.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Should I train if my muscles are sore?',
          answer: 'Mild soreness is normal, but you should avoid intense plyometric or strength training when experiencing significant muscle soreness. Instead, focus on recovery techniques like light cardio, stretching, or working different muscle groups. Listen to your body - pain is different from soreness and may indicate injury.'
        },
        {
          question: 'What if I don\'t have access to a gym?',
          answer: 'While gym equipment can be beneficial, you can make significant improvements with bodyweight exercises. Focus on squats, lunges, calf raises, and plyometric exercises like box jumps (using stairs or sturdy platforms), broad jumps, and depth jumps. Resistance bands can also be an affordable alternative to weights.'
        },
        {
          question: 'Is it better to train for strength or explosiveness?',
          answer: 'Both are important for maximizing your vertical jump. Strength provides the foundation for power, while explosiveness training teaches your muscles to apply that strength quickly. A well-designed program should include both elements, with the ratio depending on your current strengths and weaknesses.'
