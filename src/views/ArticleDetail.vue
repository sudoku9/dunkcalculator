              text: 'Plyometric training, often called "jump training" or simply "plyos," is a type of exercise that involves rapid stretching and contracting of muscles to increase power output. These exercises typically involve explosive movements where muscles exert maximum force in short intervals, helping to increase power and speed.'

            {
              title: 'The Science Behind Plyometrics',
              text: 'Plyometric exercises work by utilizing the stretch-shortening cycle (SSC) of your muscles. When a muscle is stretched quickly before contraction (eccentric phase), it stores elastic energy. When followed immediately by a concentric contraction, this stored energy is released, resulting in greater force production than a concentric contraction alone.'

              text: 'This is why a countermovement jump (where you quickly dip down before jumping) allows you to jump higher than a squat jump from a static position. Plyometric training enhances your neuromuscular system\'s ability to utilize this stretch-shortening cycle more efficiently.'
