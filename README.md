# Basketball Shot Calculator

A web-based calculator that helps basketball players optimize their shooting mechanics by calculating the ideal trajectory parameters for successful shots.

## Features

- Calculate initial velocity needed for successful shots
- Determine flight time of the basketball
- Compute maximum height of shot trajectory
- Input customization:
  - Shot distance (in feet)
  - Release height (in feet)
  - Release angle (in degrees)

## Technical Details

This calculator takes into account:
- Standard basketball hoop height (10 feet)
- Gravitational acceleration (32.2 ft/sÂ²)
- Projectile motion physics

## How to Use

1. Enter the distance from the basket (in feet)
2. Input your release height (in feet)
3. Set your preferred release angle (in degrees)
4. Click "Calculate" to see results

The calculator will display:
- Required initial velocity (ft/s)
- Total flight time (seconds)
- Maximum height reached (feet)
